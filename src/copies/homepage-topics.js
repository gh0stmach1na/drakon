  'UPPER SPINE': {
    header: "1. Upper Spine (Cervical Region)",
    location: "Located in the neck region, comprising the first seven vertebrae (C1 to C7).",
    function: "Support the weight of the head, facilitates neck movement, and protects the spinal cord.",
    commonDisorders: {
      "Cervical Spondylosis": "Degeneration of the cervical spine due to aging, causing neck pain and stiffness.",
      "Herniated Discs": "Discs between vertebrae bulge or rupture, pressing on nerves and causing pain, numbness, or weakness in the neck, arms, or hands",
      "Whiplash": "Injury from sudden jerking motion of the head, leading to strain or sprain in the neck muscles and ligaments.",
    },
    funFacts: "The cervical spine is the most flexible part of he spine, allowing for awide range of neck movements."
  },
  'MID-UPPER SPINE': {
    header: "2. Mid-Upper Spine (Thoracic Region)",
    location: "The middle segment of the spine, consisting of twelve vertebrae (T1 to T12) located between the cervical and lumbar regions.",
    function: "Provides structural support to the rib cage, protects vital organs, and assists in posture maintenance.",
    commonDisorders: {
      "Thoracic Herniated Discs": "Rupture or bulge of discs in the thoracic spine, causing back pain, numbness, or weakness in the chest, abdomen, or legs",
      "Thoracic Outlet Syndrome": "Compression of nerves or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet, leading to pain, numbness, or weakness in the arms or hands.",
      "Kyphosis": "Excessive curvature of the upper spine, resulting in a rounded or hunched back posture.",
    },
    funFacts: "The thoracic spine is relatively stable compared to other spinal regions due to the support provided by the rib cage."
  },
  'MID-LOWER SPINE': {
    header: "3. Mid-Lower Spine (Lumbar Region):",
    location: "Situated in the lower back, consisting of five vertebrae (L1 to L5) between the thoracic and sacral regions.",
    function: "Bears the majority of the body's weight, facilitates movement, and provides flexibility.",
    commonDisorders: {
      "Lumbar Herniated Discs": "Bulging or rupture of discs in the lumbar spine, causing lower back pain, sciatica, or weakness in the legs.",
      "Degenerative Disc Disease": "Wear and tear of spinal discs due to aging, resulting in lower back pain and stiffness.",
      "Spinal Stenosis": "Narrowing of the spinal canal, leading to compression of nerves and causing lower back pain, numbness, or weakness in the legs."
    },
    funFacts: "The lumbar spine is the largest and strongest segment of the vertebral column, providing stability and support to the body."
  },
  'LOWER SPINE': {
    header: "4. Lower Spine (Sacral and Coccygeal Region):",
    location: "Located at the base of the spine, consisting of the sacrum (five fused vertebrae) and the coccyx (tailbone).",
    function: "Supports the weight of the upper body, provides attachment points for muscles and ligaments, and assists in sitting and pelvic movement.",
    commonDisorders: {
      "Coccydynia": "Inflammation or injury to the coccyx, resulting in pain and discomfort while sitting or during movement.",
      "Sacral Fractures": "Fractures in the sacral region due to trauma or osteoporosis, causing lower back pain and difficulty in walking.",
      "Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction": "Dysfunction or inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, leading to lower back pain and difficulty in standing or walking."
    },
    funFacts: "The sacrum and coccyx play a crucial role in providing stability to the pelvis and supporting body weight during activities like standing, walking, or sitting."
  },
